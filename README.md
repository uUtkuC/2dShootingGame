This project is a 2d shooting game where red is the player square controlled by inputs from keyboard and mouse to shoot. Green and Black squares represent friends and enemies. 
You cannot move to a spot inhabited by a green square. If you move to the spot inhabited by a black square both of you die.
At the end a popup screen either states that you have won or lost
