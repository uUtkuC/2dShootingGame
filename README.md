This is a project that I coded during my 2nd semester in the university. Therefore it is not too efficient. Also I very highly reccomend that you run this code on a linux based OS like ubuntu.
( In my ubuntu it works fine, but in windows it is a little laggy)
This project is a 2d shooting game where red is the player square controlled by inputs from keyboard and mouse to shoot. Green and Black squares represent friends and enemies. 
You cannot move to a spot inhabited by a green square. If you move to the spot inhabited by a black square you both die.
At the end a popup screen either states that you have won or lost
